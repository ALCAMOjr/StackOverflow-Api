# StackOverflow-Like API

Welcome to the StackOverflow-like API project! This API provides core functionalities for a StackOverflow-inspired application, allowing users to interact with questions and answers similar to the popular Q&A platform. Built with the Rust programming language, Axum framework, and Tokio runtime, this API offers robust and efficient backend services.

## Project Overview

The StackOverflow-like API is designed to manage questions and answers in a way that mirrors the core functionalities of StackOverflow. This includes creating, retrieving, and deleting both questions and answers. The API provides a clean and efficient interface for performing these operations, which can be utilized by front-end applications or other services.
